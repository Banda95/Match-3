- With "The grid should provide the foundational for a solvable match with at least 3 possibilities [..] " 
	I assumed it was referring to one single initial "move" and not that the whole level had to be solvable with 3 different solutions.
- I've used iPhone 12 resolution as the default resolution and aspect ratio.
- Haven't tested all the resolution but should work in both Portrait and Landscape
- Didn't spend much time in optimization (time & memory & assets optimization) as there were not requests for it.
- The generation has some fail points that I didn't had time to tackle. If this happens it try to regenerate the grid again. Not the best solution but I was short on time to test everything.
